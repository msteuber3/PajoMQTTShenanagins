TODO - 

Add compatibility for the following devices - 
 1. Neware battery cycler
 2. Linux workstation 2 (I think)

Develop publish functions for each 
So in total there should be a python script for each that contain connection and publish info
Make a seperate login for each device


Battery cycler - 
- data stored in sql in the ib_log files in the program files

Linux 2 -
- data stored in json file BUT read off of an arduino. This may complicate things. If it is saved that'd be really convenient
